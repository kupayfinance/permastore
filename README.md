# Perma Store

Modern block chains allow for decentralized, permanent storage and therefor allow building new applications that require trust.

Perma Store exposes an API to easily store a hash of your documents on the block chain, without running your own `geth` node.

Perma Store is currently active on the KuCoin Community Chain [KCC](https://www.kcc.io/) for it's fast transactions and low gas fees.

To use our API as a service, you can sign up on the website https://permastore.app/

Perma Store is built with React and Laravel Lumen.

## Requirements

Run a full `geth` node, see https://docs.kcc.io/#/

## Installation

```
# npm install
# php artisan migrate
```

## Documentation

Documentation for using the API is published at https://docs.permastore.app/

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Lumen website](https://lumen.laravel.com/docs).
